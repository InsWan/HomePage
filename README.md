## Setting

### Blog Posts

You can simply go to `index.ts`, change the url in `getPosts()`. Most time the function will work. However, there are some other XML format different from what I have tested. So you may change the function in `page.ts`  yourself. If you are not familiar with TypeScript or JavaScript, you can start an [issue](https://github.com/yuanzui-cf/lite-page/issues/new). I will help you after noticing your issue.
